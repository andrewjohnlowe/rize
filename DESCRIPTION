Version: 0.1.0
Author: Cole Brokamp
Maintainer: Cole Brokamp <cole.brokamp@gmail.com>
Description: After locally developing a shiny application, this package will
    create a docker image which is capable of running the shiny application by
    relying on automagic to create package dependencies. This docker image can
    then be deployed to a registry or run on a server. A valid docker executable
    is required to use this package.
